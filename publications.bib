  abstract = {The current research examined whether people predict their performance on monotonous, easily accustomed, and repetitive (MEAR) tasks accurately and confirm the effects of performance feedback on their MEAR work predictions. Considering typing on the keyboard as an MEAR task in modern society, 128 university students were asked to type a 12-digit number displayed on each monitor within 5 minutes, explaining that there would be 75 typing problems and participants would receive 20 yen per correct answer. Additionally, participants were informed that they could earn money by reaching a self-determined performance target, with the condition that if they did not reach their self-set goal, they would not receive any earnings. The main findings were as follows: Regardless of the performance levels of typing on keyboards, only 23% of the participants reached the goal, indicating that the absence of performance feedback led to individuals’ overestimation of performance. In contrast, providing feedback significantly improved performance predictions: 76% of the participants reached the goal with feedback on their own performance, 70% with feedback on others’ performance, and 88% with feedback on both their own and others’ performance information. Specifically, the effects between one’s own and others’ performance feedback did not vary at statistically significant levels.}

  abstract = {With the increasing use of social-network games, game addiction has become a serious challenge to the world. This study investigates the effects of risk preference, loss aversion, and time preference on the behaviour of Japanese adolescents and young adults purchasing ‘Gacha’, or loot box gambling, in social-network games. We surveyed 1,210 respondents, aged 12 to 23 years; approximately 34% of the respondents had purchased ‘Gacha’. We found that loss-averse and risk-averse female respondents had less experience paying for ‘Gacha’, with their highest billing amount charged per month being lower than that of other female respondents. Furthermore, future-oriented female respondents had less payment experience than present-oriented ones, with the highest billing amount charged per month for the former respondents being also lower. The highest billing amount charged per month of loss-averse male respondents was significantly lower than that of other male respondents.}

  abstract = {In preventing lifestyle-related diseases, appropriate interventions in advance for those at high risk is essential. In Japan, public health insurers are mandated to provide Specific Health Guidance for lifestyle changes. However, encouraging people to participate in the guidance is a difficult task. We examine the effects of positive and negative graphics in direct mail leaflets on the participation in the Specific Health Guidance among adults at risk of cardiovascular disease. We conduct a randomized controlled trial at a municipality located in a suburb of Osaka in the fiscal years 2016 and 2017. We randomly assign 560 and 467 participants in each fiscal year to one of three groups with positive or negative graphics or no leaflet. The difference in encouraging attendance between the positive and negative graphics is not significant. Limited evidence of the effectiveness of the positive or negative graphics is obtained for certain groups of people. The Specific Health Guidance attendance rate differs between the no leaflet group (24.2%) and the leaflet with negative graphics group (29.9%) for new participants in 2016 and 2017.}

Second, the wage cut treatment reduces the wage rate and the tax increase treatment increases the tax (the real wage is equal for both treatments); wage and tax remain unchanged for the control group. Both treatments had significantly smaller increases in effort levels than the control group and the increases are not different between treatments. Therefore, net wage illusion and tax aversion identified in previous studies are not supported.}

  abstract = {Using original purpose-built 2018 Japanese survey data, we estimate the financial behaviors and attitudes of households. We find that financial literacy plays an important and consistent role in financial decision-making. However, the actual behaviors are counter-intuitive: people with high levels of financial literacy tend to take too many risks, overborrow, and hold naive financial attitudes. That is, financial literacy tends to cause people to become daring and reckless toward some financial aspects. By contrast, financially literate people are better at retirement planning and are indifferent to gambling. Preferences such as risk and loss aversions and discount factors, also play a role in financial choices.}

However, it is not obvious whether people think in that way. We use a choice experiment to test the equivalence between income and consumption taxes. Subjects were asked to choose a preferred tax among 20% income tax and 25% consumption tax, 20% income tax and 22% consumption tax, and 20% income tax and 20% consumption tax under a given set of income and consumption parameters. We find that (1) when effective tax burdens are equivalent, subjects prefer income tax to consumption tax, (2) when the nominal consumption tax rate is higher than the nominal income tax rate, they prefer income tax, despite heavier tax burden, and (3) when nominal tax rates are identical, they prefer consumption tax. These findings imply that the subjects do not think theoretically equivalent taxes are equivalent because the subjects miscalculate the consumption tax burden. Moreover, our result shows that only one-third of the subjects appear to choose a tax regime based on accurately calculated tax burdens.}

  abstract = {Public housing corporations (Jyutaku-kyokyu-kosha) in Japan have financial problems due to a decline in land prices and an increase in the vacancy rate of specified good rental housing (Toku-yu-chin). Osaka municipal housing corporation started fixed-term cashback programs for new renters from 2004 to reduce the vacancy rate. This paper examines the effects of these programs on the exit behavior of renters using a survival analysis. We found: (1) renters who receive a cashback exit earlier, especially when the cashback expires; and, (2) newlyweds and child-raising families who receive cashbacks do not exit earlier significantly. This result suggests that public housing corporations can reduce the number of vacant rooms using a cashback program for newlyweds and child-raising families.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a survey of research utilizing insights from behavioral economics in the economic analysis of taxation and benefits and discusses Japan’s taxation and benefits policies from the viewpoint of behavioral economics. Behavioral economics is a collective term that is applied to research based on models in which the agent behaves under assumptions that differ from the “standard assumptions.” In recent years, there has been a sudden upsurge in research, even in theoretical analysis and empirical research on taxation and benefits. Specifically, studies are being conducted on topics such as tax-related inattention, the impact of taxation and benefits complexity, institutional design of retirement savings and pensions, promotion of tax payment, and the effects of benefits on labor, education and medical care. From the theoretical aspect, researchers are studying its relationship with optimal taxation. Knowledge of behavioral economics offers a new perspective to evaluate systems and policies related to taxation and benefits in Japan and has the potential to propose institutional design that is based on a more realistic image of humankind.}

  abstract = {This study examines whether people are inattentive to once-in-a-lifetime events. Using data from Japanese entrance examinations, we show that, even in situations where there appears to be little difference in the actual admissions probability, students change their school of choice simply because the coarse label describing admissions probability has changed. To understand the mechanism behind this result, we model students' application decisions by incorporating inattention. The results suggest that, in once-in-a-lifetime situations, students do observe information more carefully than usual, but they still cannot be completely attentive. We also find that people with better information processing skills and who are accustomed to processing more information daily pay greater attention to information.}

It empirically analyzes how gender differences in preferences related to distance from home impact gender disparities in public medical school admissions in Japan. Our results indicate that females incur greater costs associated with distance compared to males. While financial aid to offset distance-related costs can increase the proportion of female applicants to medical schools, it does not lead to a corresponding increase in female admissions due to the effects of competition. We propose a financially feasible alternative affirmative action policy that provides financial aid exclusively to female students to reduce the gender gap.}

Then, we conclude that the aversion behaviors in NA and HA are consistent with the existing economic theories such as the ambiguity aversion model and prospect theory; on the contrary, those in LA cannot be solved by them even if we combine them.}
